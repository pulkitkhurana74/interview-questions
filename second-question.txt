My response:-
You mentioned the UI error: "package can’t be synchronised". After replicating the issue on my side, I discovered that you were uploading a .zip file. Cloudsmith requires .tgz files generated by the npm pack command for NPM uploads—this is essential for including the correct metadata (package.json) and structure so our system can process the package properly. You can confirm this from our documentation:
“To upload via the Cloudsmith CLI / API, you'll need to generate your package first with npm pack. This creates a .tgz file... and can then be uploaded with cloudsmith push npm OWNER/REPOSITORY <file>.tgz.”
How to Fix It:-
In your project root, run:
npm pack
This should produce a file like your-package-1.2.3.tgz.
Upload this .tgz file through the Cloudsmith UI, or via CLI:
cloudsmith push npm <your-org>/<your-repo> your-package-1.2.3.tgz


After this, the package should synchronize correctly and become available in your repository.

To help optimize your workflow moving forward—was the .zip file generated manually, or via another packaging tool?

Please give the repackaging a try and let me know how it goes. I’m here to support you through the rest of your trial—and ensure it’s a success!
