Thanks for getting in touch. I can imagine how frustrating it must be to hit this kind of blocker during your trial, especially when you’re evaluating Cloudsmith for important use. I took a look at the package you shared and was able to reproduce the issue.

Here’s what I found:

The file uploaded was a .zip containing your package metadata (package.json).

Inside the package.json, the name field was set as an empty array ([]) instead of a string. This caused the validation to fail when Cloudsmith tried to synchronise the package.

Cloudsmith also expects NPM packages to be uploaded as .tgz files generated by npm pack, rather than raw .zip archives.

Here’s what I did to get it working:

Extracted the files from the .zip.

Updated the package.json so that the name is a string (for example: "my-package") and the version follows semantic versioning (like "0.0.1").

Ran npm pack in the package directory, which generated a proper .tgz file (e.g. my-package-0.0.1.tgz).

Uploaded that .tgz file to Cloudsmith, and it synchronised successfully.


Next steps for you:

Update your package.json with a valid name and version.

Run npm pack to create the .tgz.

Upload the .tgz to your Cloudsmith repo instead of the .zip.

That should get you up and running. Here’s a reference guide you might find useful:
