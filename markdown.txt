In build.yml:-


1.) In build job, the step:
    - name: Build package
    Is empty — it does not have a run: or uses: directive.
    Because of this, nothing is actually building your Python package, so the dist/ folder will be missing, and the Upload artifact step will fail with no files found.
    We need to run the package build command.

2.) We have defined an output (artifact_name) but never set it in any step.
    For outputs to work, we must explicitly set them with:
    echo "artifact_name=python-package" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

3.) Artifact upload will fail:-
    Since our Build step does nothing, the dist/ folder won’t exist → this step will throw an error.


 In promote_package.yml

4.) We have Swapped repo names in env:-
    CLOUDSMITH_STAGING_REPO: 'production'
    CLOUDSMITH_PRODUCTION_REPO: 'staging'


    We are searching in production and promoting to staging — which is the opposite

5.) permissions are incomplete:-
    OIDC requires contents: read too i.e., to fetch workflow context and verify.

6.) JQ is may not preinstalled in ubuntu-latest box, so we need to add one step before to add jq package.

In release_package.yml:-

7.) cloudsmith cli is not installed and we are using cloudsmith command.
